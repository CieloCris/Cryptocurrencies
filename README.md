# Cryptocurrencies Analysis with Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

The purpose of our project is to analyze cryptocurrency data using an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm in order to know how to group data into a classification system for an investment.

To achieve this objective, We utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, hvplot, and Plotly.

## Results

The charts below show some visualizations after using a unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm (K-Mean) to group cryptocurrency data.
