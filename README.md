# Cryptocurrencies Analysis with Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

The **purpose** of our project is to analyze cryptocurrency data using an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm in order to know how to group data into a classification system for an investment.

To accomplish our goal, We performed four technical analysis that consist of (1) preprocessing the data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), (2) reducing data dimensions using PCA, (3) clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and (4) vizualizing cryptocurrencies results. 

As **resources** for the project, We utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, hvplot, and Plotly.

## Results

The charts below show some visualizations after using an unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm (K-Mean) to group cryptocurrency data.
